/// <summary>
/// Contains useful constants and functions for producing strengths for use in the constraint solver.
/// Each constraint added to the solver has an associated strength specifying the precedence the solver should
/// impose when choosing which constraints to enforce. It will try to enforce all constraints, but if that
/// is impossible the lowest strength constraints are the first to be violated.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///     Strengths are simply real numbers. The strongest legal strength is 1,001,001,000.0. The weakest is 0.0.
///     For convenience constants are declared for commonly used strengths. These are <see cref="Required" />, <see cref="Strong" />,
///     <see cref="Medium" /> and <see cref="Weak" />. Feel free to multiply these by other values to get intermediate strengths.
///     Note that the solver will clip given strengths to the legal range.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///     <see cref="Required" /> signifies a constraint that cannot be violated under any circumstance. Use this special strength
///     sparingly, as the solver will fail completely if it find that not all of the `REQUIRED` constraints
///     can be satisfied. The other strengths represent fallible constraints. These should be the most
///     commonly used strenghts for use cases where violating a constraint is acceptable or even desired.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///     The solver will try to get as close to satisfying the constraints it violates as possible, strongest first.
///     This behaviour can be used (for example) to provide a "default" value for a variable should no other
///     stronger constraints be put upon it.
