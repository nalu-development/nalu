VirtualScroll Dual License

Copyright (c) 2026 Alberto Aldegheri

The `Nalu.Maui.VirtualScroll` component (the "Software") is made available
under a **dual licensing model**:

- **MIT License** for **Non-Commercial Use**
- **Sponsor License** for **Commercial Use**

You may choose the license that applies to your use case.

---

## 1. MIT License – Non-Commercial Use (Conditional)

You are granted permission to use the Software under the terms of the
MIT License **solely for non-commercial use**.

The MIT License applies **only while** the Software is used in a
non-commercial context.

If the Software, or any portion thereof, is used, distributed, or
integrated into a commercial project or activity, **this MIT license
grant automatically terminates**, and a valid Sponsor License is
required.

For non-commercial use only, the Software is licensed under the
standard MIT License. When redistributing the Software in a
non-commercial context, you must comply with the terms of the MIT
License, including the inclusion of the copyright notice and license
text.

The MIT License grant described above is conditional and does not
survive a change in the nature of use from non-commercial to commercial.

When redistributing the Software, in whole or in part, under the MIT
License for non-commercial use, you must include **this entire license
file (`LICENSE.md`)**, without modification.

Redistribution of the Software accompanied only by the MIT License text,
or by any subset of this license, is not permitted.

Any redistribution that omits or alters the terms of this dual license
model is considered unauthorized and voids all licensing rights.

## 2. Sponsor License – Commercial Use

If you use the Software for **commercial purposes**, you must obtain a
Sponsor License by maintaining an **active GitHub Sponsors subscription**
to the `nalu-development/nalu` author via https://github.com/sponsors/albyrock87
at a tier that includes VirtualScroll usage for your use case.

Commercial use includes, but is not limited to:
- Use in software or services that are sold or licensed for a fee
- Use in software or services that generate revenue, directly or indirectly
- Use in internal tools of for-profit organizations
- Use in consulting, freelance, or contract work
- Use by for-profit entities for any purpose

---

## 3. Sponsor License Terms

While you maintain an active qualifying sponsorship, you are granted a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

- Use, copy, modify, and integrate the Software
- Use the Software in proprietary or closed-source projects
- Distribute compiled applications that include the Software

This license is valid **only while the sponsorship remains active**.

**Legacy Use & Business Termination:**
In the event that a commercial entity ceases active operations (e.g., business closure or dissolution),
any compiled applications already distributed to end-users or available on public app stores may remain in place without an active sponsorship.
This "legacy" permission applies only to existing versions of the Software; any further development or new projects would require a new, valid license.

---

## 4. Restrictions

You may NOT:
- Redistribute or sublicense the Software as a standalone product
- Remove or alter copyright notices
- Claim authorship of the Software

Use of the Software under the MIT License does not grant the right to
relicense, sublicense, or otherwise redistribute the Software for
commercial purposes.

---

## 5. No Services or Support Obligation

This license grants usage rights only and does not include support,
maintenance, consulting, or development services.

---

## 6. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
