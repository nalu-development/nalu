# CodeQL Code Scanning
# Analyses your code for security vulnerabilities and coding errors.
# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository. You may wish to alter this file to override
# the set of languages analyzed, or to provide custom queries or build logic.
